# vision-transformer-from-scratch
This repository includes a basic vision transformer from scratch so that  one beginner can understand the theory of vision transformer easily. The basic transformer and the linformer both are trained and tested.

Requirements:
PyTorch (>= 1.6.0);
Python 3.6.9;
Numpy (1.18.2);
OpenCV ;
Linformer;

Train the model:
python main_train.py;
In the main_train.py the basic transformer and the linformer can be selected.

Test the model:
python test.py;
In the main_train.py the basic transformer and the linformer can be selected.

The theory of vision transformer can reference the following document:
