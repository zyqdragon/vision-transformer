# vision-transformer-from-scratch
This repository includes a basic vision transformer from scratch so that  one beginner can understand the theory of vision transformer easily. The basic transformer and the linformer both are trained and tested.

Requirements:
Python 3.6.9
Numpy (1.18.2)
OpenCV (4.5.1 supported, see below for a suggested python installation)
PyTorch (>= 1.6.0)
Linformer

Train the model:
python main_train.py
In the main_train.py the basic transformer and the linformer can be selected.

Test the model:
python test.py
In the main_train.py the basic transformer and the linformer can be selected.
